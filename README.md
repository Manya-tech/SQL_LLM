# Gemini SQL Query Assistant

Gemini SQL Query Assistant is a Streamlit web application powered by Gemini LLM (Large Language Model). It allows users to ask natural language questions about a SQL database and receive relevant query results.

## Description

This project leverages the Gemini LLM model to interpret natural language queries and translate them into SQL queries. Users can interact with the web application through a simple interface where they can type or speak their queries. The application then processes the input using Gemini to generate SQL queries, executes them against the specified database, and displays the results in a user-friendly format.

### Features

- Natural Language Query Interface: Users can input queries in natural language, allowing for intuitive interaction.
- SQL Query Generation: Gemini LLM generates SQL queries based on the user's input.
- Database Interaction: The application connects to a specified SQL database to execute queries.
- Streamlit Web Interface: The user interface is built using Streamlit, providing a seamless experience.
